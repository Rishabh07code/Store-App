# StoreRating - Minimal Dev Setup

This workspace contains a minimal Vite + React app with your StoreRating UI component.

To run locally (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:/Users/risha/OneDrive/Desktop/roxiler project"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) in the browser.

Notes:
- Tailwind is loaded via CDN in `index.html` for quick styling in dev. For production, install and configure Tailwind properly.
- This is a local demo using in-memory data only (no backend or persistence).
